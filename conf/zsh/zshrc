# Prompt

# This is my ultimate minimalist prompt, which consists of two parts. The first
# part checks the exist code of the last command executed. If the code is zero,
# it displays nothing. Otherwise, it shows a non-zero exit code in red and in
# parentheses.
return_code='%(?..%F{red}(%?%)%f)'

# The second part is simply the current directory, shown in bold and blue.
current_dir='%B%F{blue}%~%f%b'

# $PROMPT is the equivalent if $PS1
PROMPT="${return_code} ${current_dir} %# "
